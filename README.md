# litcheelab badges

Hi humans,

This is a badges system we developed for kids aged from 8-14 in China to help them get a general idea about what tech can create and what does it mean to be a maker. If you are an educator/parent/student interested in using these image. Feel free to use them, and don't forget to give us credits. We would love to hear your feedback and progress.

thanks,

Litchee Lab team
